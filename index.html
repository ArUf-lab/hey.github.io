        My Dearest KOHINUR 
        
       <br> As this year draws to a close, I find myself reflecting on all the incredible moments we’ve shared. Every smile, every laugh, every quiet moment we’ve spent together has been a gift I cherish deeply. You have brought light into my life in ways I never thought possible, and for that, I am endlessly grateful.  
        
        This past year, you’ve shown me what love truly means. Your kindness, strength, and unwavering support have been my anchor. In your eyes, I see my future; in your embrace, I find my home.  
        
        As the clock ticks toward midnight and we step into the new year, I want you to know how much you mean to me. You are my heart, my soul, and my everything. My resolution is simple: to love you more, cherish you deeply, and create even more beautiful memories together.  
        
        Here’s to us, my love — to the dreams we’ll chase, the laughter we’ll share, and the love that will only grow stronger. Thank you for being you. Thank you for being mine.  
        
       Happy New Year, my love.
       <br> Forever yours,<br>
      ARUF❤️  <br
